My friends, who are 17–18-year-old males, have devoted their eyeballs to Netflix’s latest reality show: Too Hot To Handle, where attractive singles spend a month on a desert island trying not to advance the human species together (no sex).

These are guys who read self-help books and publish on Medium, guys who I admire. My point? Netflix has successfully stolen my friend group’s souls, AND I WANT THEM BACK. Slow clap, Netflix, slow clap.

Quarantine has people flocking to their screens and Joe Exotic’ mullet, and the streaming giant’s market cap is almost $187 billion now — just above Disney’s. With all this momentum, don’t be surprised if the firm starts making baller moves to grow its reach.

I got Netflix two months ago, so I’m already an expert — here are my unrequested (and probably unqualified) ideas for where Netflix could be heading next.

### 1. Face the music: Netflix acquires Spotify

Spotify is struggling against Apple’s powerful verticals (Apple Music) and lacks exclusive content — their original podcast offerings don’t provide the same competitive advantage that Stranger Things and Money Heist do.

> You’re watching a movie or show and a song you like comes on — Netflix then gives you the option to add it to a playlist.

A Netflix team-up might give consumers a reason to raise the proverbial eyebrow. Both platforms have excellent AI recommendation engines, which leaves an opportunity for cross-platform data sharing — can your music taste inform what kind of show you want to watch? And vice-versa?

Recurring revenue bundles (rundles) also go a long way in today’s monopoly market. A Netflix deal could allow the firms to build a compelling rundle — music + entertainment could make Spotify more competitive.

### 2. Pro gamer move: Netflix acquires Sony

Acquiring Sony could solidify verticals for Netflix: Sony TVs and PlayStation game consoles. Netflix also gets a huge media catalogue (one that includes The Emoji Movie, so I guess it’s not a total win) AND it comes pre-installed on the next PlayStation with a free trial to onboard new users? Baller move.

> High-quality interactive VR content might push the platform forward.

Netflix would also get access to Sony’s VR offering, which could be the next step in interactive entertainment on the platform. Remember Black Mirror Bandersnatch? High-quality interactive VR content might be the next step forward.

Not to mention, tying PlayStation Now (the cloud gaming library subscription) with Netflix could be a compelling rundle.

### 3. Globetrotter: Netflix goes all-in on foreign entertainment

Have you ever purchased expensive Dutch vodka so you can impress the foreign exchange student from the Netherlands? Yeah, me neither.

> Over 60% of Netflix subscribers are from outside of the U.S.

Companies expanding into foreign markets will sometimes buy native firms as a way to build their presence, and most of Netflix’s future growth will probably come from international markets.

Netflix plans to grow its audiences in Asia, Europe, and South America, focusing on countries with good broadband and strong mobile presence — talent from Germany, Brazil, and India can expect a deal soon.

The strategy to produce international content that can also be popular in the U.S. is working out — look at Money Heist, Elite, and new action flick Extraction, which stars Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, Bollywood actor Randeep Houda, and is set in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Weaker international competition also means Netflix gets exclusive licensing deals, like all the Studio Ghibli films. Cha-ching.

### 4. Package deal: Netflix acquires Vox Media

Short-form content designed for mobile isn’t winning right now — it can explain Quibi’s lacklustre performance these past few weeks. But when quarantine is over, we can probably expect mobile-focused content to take over again.

> Vox Media’s mobile offerings can be valuable for Netflix’s mobile-only offerings in India

High-production offerings with an under-5-minute time signature would allow Netflix to occupy our afternoon hours AND the in-between periods throughout our day — waiting for that Uber, in line at Starbucks, answering nature’s call.

A firm like Vox Media (Vox, The Verge, SB Nation, Polygon) diversifies the platform’s niche offerings and gives Netflix a massive library of written, audio, and video content — and the talent pool that produces it.

### Netflix is killing it

The streaming platform is an OG in the space and that “ba-boom” has a special place in all our hearts. Netflix is the only FAANG company that hasn’t had a massive data scandal in the past five years, so kudos to Reed Hastings and the team.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go finish this season of Too Hot To Handle. For research purposes.
