I’m Canadian, which means I drink milk out of a bag, ride a polar bear to school, and my blood type is maple syrup. It also means I was founded in the same place as e-commerce platform Shopify.

Shopify is the company powering online stores and POS for 1,000,000+ business, including brands like Allbirds, October’s Very Own, and Heinz.

In 2019, they made it clear that they were coming after Amazon, but tackling a company that sheds/gains the value of the American airline industry in a single trading day is a feat of Herculean proportions; how could Shopify do it?

Although Amazon is likely to be the first $2 trillion company in the world, Shopify has made some key moves in the past few months that might pave the way for the Canadian Invasion.

## 1. Including a ‘BNPL’ installment system

### BNPL: Buy now, pay later.

Shopify’s plans for ‘Shop Pay Installments’ were recently unveiled at their Reunite conference. The payment service would customers pay for items on Shopify stores in 4 **monthly installments** with no interest.

BNPL firms like Klarna and Afterpay have made interesting splashes in recent years, but the payment structure alone doesn’t seem like enough to be the foundation for long-term business, especially with Visa and Mastercard getting in the ring.

Offering BNPL as a feature for your Shopify store, however, is a gangster move:

- Lower item prices generally **boost average order value** — if you feel like you’re spending less per item, you’ll spend more money on the basket overall.
- Merchants get a kind of **monthly recurring revenue**, a hallmark of a great business.
- It allows consumers to separate the pain of paying with the pleasure of consuming by slotting in more time between the use of the product and the payment for it — again, it **increases sales**.

Smart move by Shopify — especially in these times of unemployment and financial insecurity, this system could be very attractive to consumers.

## 2. Shopify Fulfillment means vertical integration

### If you took a shot every time I mentioned vertical integration in my articles, I would suddenly seem far more charming and attractive.

I bring it up so much because vertical integration (the business strategy where you control every part of the supply chain) is a superpower in this economy.

When Apple opened its own retail locations and Amazon started doing its own fulfillment, it generated huge gains in shareholder value.

> Verticals cut costs and increase profits.

Shopify Fulfillment Network allows Shopify to do just that. With the company providing platform, payment, *and* delivery products for merchants, we can expect **faster/cheaper local delivery** and better customer service.

It’s the next logical step for the platform and adds some major *cojones* to its bid for the e-commerce space.

## 3. Shop provides a centralized marketplace

### Shopify has updated its order tracking app Arrive into Shop.

It’s a platform that allows users to follow local brands, discover new stores, order products and track them all from within the app.

> Think Amazon meets Instagram, they both have a baby, and the baby grows up in a cool neighbourhood in New York before eventually moving to Canada.

Okay, that’s description may have some problems — and so does Shop. It’s received criticism for its **weak discovery functionality** (among other technical bugs) but, much like a naive romantic partner, I can see past those flaws.

Shop is how Shopify centralizes all of its merchants on a **direct-to-consumer platform**, favouring businesses in the users’ locales so Shopify merchants aren’t pitted against each other.

Platforms tend to benefit from **network effects**, and if Shop gains enough traction, it could eventually (in some form) contest that Amazon app on your home screen for market share in online retail.

### That classic Canadian charisma

This pandemic accelerates meaningful trends — one of those is e-commerce. Shopify’s product offerings and their dedication to SME’s may pave the way for a more ethical way of doing business online in the future.

The bases are loaded, and all Shopify needs to do is make a home-run swing. Whether that looks like an acquisition or yet another product offering is uncertain for now.

But I guess only time will tell, eh?
