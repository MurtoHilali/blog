Velodyne is a startup that specializes **Li**ght **D**etection **a**nd **R**anging tech, or LIDAR for short— it’s a good position to be in, especially since they’ll be the ones supplying our autonomous vehicle overlords in the future.

They’re going public via a **special-purpose acquisition company** — condensable to the oh-so-sexy acronym **SPAC** — called Graf Industrial Corp. And we can expect many hardware/autonomous vehicles startups going down this path in the future.

Okay, I just threw an Irish stew of information at your brain. I apologize. I’ll make it up to you by explaining LIDAR, SPACs, and why you should care about them at all.

### **LIDAR is a core technology that powers self-driving cars.**

It’s also what I’m naming my new cover band where we do 90’s themed remixes of Lionel Richie songs.

LIDAR systems are usually (not always) mounted on top of self-driving cars/other autonomous vehicles (AVs):

Besides being a very fashionable top hat for you car, LIDAR systems are core to helping an AV “see”.

A LIDAR system is like a group of TIE fighters strapped to your car roof — they’re constantly shooting out lasers. Most used to spin, but modern ones are smaller and will still provide a 360° view.

*“Pew pew pew”

Thousands of laser pulses are sent out every second. *Every SECOND.* When they hit an object and bounce back to the LIDAR, the reflection points are recorded to build a 3D point cloud. This can be done because we know how fast light is and how far it travels.

That cloud can then be turned into a 3D representation of the car’s surroundings. Here’s a look at how Uber tackles the problem:

**Velodyne** is a huge player in the LIDAR market. They’re one of the OGs in the space and they’ve kept up with industry innovations via sexy, smaller lidars.

As you can see, LIDAR is pretty great at telling the car how far away things are, but not really great at telling the car *what* they are. Because of this, most current AV approaches combine LIDAR data with camera + visual recognition data.

### SPACs

Special-purpose acquisition companies. Are these a newfangled contraption Wall Street is using to bamboozle you? Maybe…

SPACs are companies without any real commercial operations. Their only purpose is to acquire a private company after raising capital through an initial public offering (IPO).

There I go again, throwing that Irish stew into your brainhole — let’s break this down.

At the end of the day, **a corporation is just a few words on paper.** Armed with this info, investors and industry experts will sometimes form a SPAC with the goal of **buying a private company in that industry** down the road.

It’s like being a really rich kid in school with no real plans for studying, just figuring out who you should pay to do your homework.

SPACs raise money (aka capital) to help finance these acquisition/mergers. They do this by **offering an IPO**, or going public. This is when shares in a privately held corporation are now available for purchase by public investors (you and me!)

Then **the SPAC has about 2 years to buy/merge with the company** it wants. When that deal closes, the private firm/startup basically replaces the SPAC on the stock market. It’s like an empty container full of cash, or a “blank-check company”.

**Graf Industrial Corp.** (GRAF: NYSE) is the SPAC that Velodyne is doing its reverse merger with — they raised over $200 million after going public in 2018.

After this upcoming merger, GRAF will be baptized in the waters of techno-capitalism and emerge renamed as “VLDR”.

### **Why does this matter?**

For one, researchers are predicting that the advancement of autonomous vehicles will eventually force us to merge consciousness with them, resulting in organometallic and sapient AVs. Early predictions of this future were visualized by hit Pixar movie, *Cars (2006).*

Okay, maybe that’s not entirely true.

But the self-driving car market is valued at nearly [$25 billion](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/18/2002529/0/en/Global-Autonomous-Driverless-Car-Market-Projections-2020-2025-World-Market-Anticipating-a-CAGR-of-18.html#:~:text=The%20global%20autonomous%2Fdriverless%20car,order%20to%20sense%20their%20environment.), and **set to grow at around 18% until 2025**. They have massive potential to reduce car accidents and deaths, maybe even help fight climate change.

**LIDAR may not be the future, though.** Some people (like a guy named, Elon Musk — maybe you’ve heard of him?) call LIDAR a crutch, and that we should develop **visual recognition technology** that renders it obsolete.

To his credit, some [research](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/#:~:text=And%20almost%20all%20of%20them,showcasing%20Tesla%27s%20self%2Ddriving%20technology.) has been pointing in this direction.

On the business side, startup founders all want to eventually “exit”, which means:

1. Selling your company to a bigger one to liquidate your equity (i.e. turn it into cash)…
2. …or doing an IPO. That means you can sell your shares and buy a lambo, if you’d like.

SPACs have become an **increasingly popular path for startups** to do the latter.

Doing an IPO with a big investment bank like Goldman Sachs is complex, with more negotiations and stakeholders than a Thanksgiving dinner.

SPAC negotiations are simpler, and they provide some certainty for capital, which is **critical for capital-intensive ops** like Velodyne or Nikola, the EV company that also went public with a SPAC.

Expect to see more companies (especially automobile startups) leaning towards this path vs. a traditional IPO. I, for one, am still looking for investment into my Lionel Richie cover band.
