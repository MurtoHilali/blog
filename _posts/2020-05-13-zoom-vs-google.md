When I was in kindergarten, I was hopelessly in love with a female classmate whose face I never actually saw (she wore a veil). I can confidently say that today, 14 years later, I am totally over her. 

My point? Faces are important for humans, and we need to see them so we can make GENUINE CONNECTIONS.

For this reason, video conferencing for businesses and families has exploded in the past two months, with Zoom and its **$38 billion** valuation at the forefront.

#### Point I for Google: Monopoly power

Monopolistic firms like Google are so big and powerful, they can forgo profits if it means growing market share. You can call it revenue maximization or predatory pricing depending on how legal it is.

When Amazon was just a baby mega-conglomerate, Diapers.com was refusing to sell. Amazon sold diapers at a loss, undercutting Diapers.com revenues until they finally agreed to be acquired.

> Amazon could afford to sell at a loss because their other revenue streams made up for it — Google can offer Meet for free for the same reason.

Market share is valuable because once enough people start using Meet, Google can flip the revenue switch.

All things considered, Google says it’s doing this to help families/businesses connect during quarantine, and I support that. I guess it doesn’t hurt that people (LIKE ME) will now spend even more time on Google.

#### Point II for Google: Network effects

As more people join a network, the more useful it becomes for each user. Since the average value for each user goes up, more people join the network.

That (simply put) is the network effect, and it’s a big part of why so many monopolies are digital today — the bigger they get, the better they get.

Google built NFX through Search (more users = better algorithms/better results = more users) and AdSense, resulting in billions of Google service users. They can leverage their enormous userbase to onboard onto Meet. The best way to do this?

#### Point III for Google: Bundling

Slack is a cloud-based team collaboration software that was quickly gaining popularity among some of the biggest companies in the world — then Microsoft bundled Teams in for free with the rest of Office and is bleeding Slack dry.

> Zoom integrates well with Google services already, but it’ll be hard to compete with a proprietary offering.

Meet is bundled with Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, and the other G Suite services used by over 6 million paying businesses and 120 million students/educators — a metaphorical Infinity Gauntlet snap to obliterate Zoom’s face.

#### Point I for Zoom: Brand equity

Zoom has seen explosive growth during this crisis, with over 300 million daily meeting participants this month and stock prices skyrocketing. Zoom has become synonymous with video conferencing, matched only by Cisco Webex.

The service is building strong brand awareness and is quickly coming to be seen as the default video conferencing platform. However, brand identity is not a very strong economic moat, and Google is king at efficiency.

We’ll have to see if Zoom’s early adoption wave will be strong enough to fend off the Deathstar laser that is Google meet.

#### Point II for Zoom: Specialization

Google’s parent company is called Alphabet; maybe because the human alphabet is “one of humanity’s most important innovations”, or maybe because they’re building enough companies to have one named for each letter of the alphabet.

> One of Google’s strong points is that it does everything. One of its weak points is that it doesn’t always do it well.

Reviews for Meet are mostly positive, (aside from a few criticisms involving audio quality issues for large groups) but it’s no match for Zoom’s diverse feature set, including meeting, conferencing, and webinar capabilities.

When companies specialize, they can excel in their domain. Video conferencing is Zoom’s whole thing, and they’ve gotten pretty good at it — except for those pesky security issues.

***

#### It’s too soon to tell.

Zoom has seen formidable growth, specializes in what it’s doing, and is quickly become a household name — Google can leverage its monopoly power, service bundles, and network effects to sweep the rug out from under them.

Google will have time to improve Meet over the next few months, but we can remain optimistic about Zoom’s prospects in the space.

You know, I haven’t talked to my kindergarten crush in forever. Maybe I’ll call her — you know, just to see how she’s doing. No other reason.
