By the end of 2020, the global gaming industry will be worth more than double the global recorded music industry and the global box office.

*Combined.*

With the video game industry’s expected 2020 revenue at $160 billion, it’s no surprise that Amazon is pushing into the industry with original content: sci-fi shooter Crucible and fantasy MMO New World.

**Why is Amazon making games?**

### Amazon is uniquely positioned to win here.

#### I’ve got my head in the clouds (based gaming)

**Cloud gaming** is when you’re playing a game that’s running on a server somewhere in Singapore (maybe) instead of your local computer or console, but is streaming to your screen at high speeds.

This technology lets you can play games on any device with an (excellent) Internet connection — **no expensive hardware needed**. You may have heard of Google’s colourful offering, Stadia.

You need a crazy amount of server infrastructure to load, render, and stream high-resolution games at high speed — sounds like a job for Amazon.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) has a **33% market share in the global cloud infrastructure services market**; setting up a cloud gaming service should be like making your husband disappear by dousing him in sardine oil and feeding him to your pet tigers— no problem at all.

#### Cloud gaming goes hand-in-hand with gaming subscriptions.

The future of gaming will be subscription-based. Instead of paying for a new game whenever one comes out, people will pay a monthly fee for access to a consistently updated library — think **Netflix for video games**.

Xbox Games Pass and PlayStation Now already allow you to host your library on the cloud (an external server). I expect Amazon to follow suit.

Companies will tie gaming subscriptions with cloud gaming: imagine you could access your entire library AND high-performance hardware through the cloud — anywhere, anytime, on any device.

#### Original content = differentiation & vertical integration

People will tend to buy one subscription service over the other based on the original content each has to offer (Tiger King, anyone?)

More importantly, original content means you can vertically integrate, or control every part of the supply chain — that means production, distribution, etc.

* **Production**: Amazon Game Studios, acquisition of Double Helix Studios, world-class talent — the tech firm is equipped to start pumping out original content.
* **Distribution**: 83% of all video games are already sold digitally, so the largest online retailer in the world will leverage its size to beat out giants like Steam through a subscription service + cloud gaming platform. We’ll probably see Fire TV play a role in accessing these services.
* **Media**: Amazon owns Twitch, the video game streaming platform that people have collectively spent over 355 billion minutes watching. That’s over 675,000 years, or the roughly length of time it will take for me to pay off my student loans.

Vertical integration lowers costs, improves efficiency, and boosts profits — something that will come in handy with so many people staying home and gaming in the next 12–24 months.

#### The main reason video games will help Amazon take over the world:

This gaming subscription service I keep predicting will probably be bundled in with Amazon Prime, the second-most valuable **recurring revenue bundle (rundle)** in the world (the first is Microsoft Office).

**Recurring revenue** comes from subscription services, the most popular business model in the world right now.

**Bundles**: If you throw a bunch of products/services together in a ‘discounted’ bundle, it allows you to sell more, get rid of less valuable merchandise, and increase the perceived value of each purchase.

Bundle a bunch of subscriptions together and you get the sexy title of the **rundle**. Microsoft Office 365 and Adobe Creative Cloud are great examples. Apple, a company that has mastered vertical integration, will probably roll out its own rundle consisting of Apple News, TV+, Arcade, and Music.

Prime offers music, video, e-reading, photo storage, and free shipping: add a cloud gaming library to the mix and you have one the sexiest rundles on the market.

#### The flywheel effect

Rundles are valuable because they can act as **flywheels**. According to Scott Galloway (NYU marketing professor), a flywheel describes a “…company’s ability to monetize content/loyalty across other business units.”

Rundles generate revenue for other parts of the business — customers fall in love with John Krasinski’s beard in Jack Ryan on Prime Video and stay on the platform long enough to start making more purchases on Amazon.com.

> Rundles build loyalty and loyalty is profitable.

With original content, cloud gaming, and gaming subscriptions probably coming to Prime soon, expect Amazon to dominate even more of the market and get one step closer to world domination.
