If 2019 was a year of revolution, 2020 is the year of crisis. Luckily, there are still a few added sprinkles of revolution. Really, really, dumb revolution.

Protests against social distancing measures have been popping up in Vancouver, Michigan, and Minnesota. That’s right — people who are upset that they’ve been drafted by the government to sit on their couch and WATCH NETFLIX ALL DAY.

> What a time to be alive.

This is going to be tough on us, I get it. We’re entering a recession, people will lose their jobs, and toilet paper has replaced the U.S. dollar as a global currency.

> But the alternative is the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.

In all seriousness, people protesting because their incomes and their kids’ educations are on the line is understandable, and I sympathize for them — but what about the privileged people who can afford to quarantine but still choose no to?

Our parents and grandparents lived through wars + not being able to binge-watch 5 seasons of The Office in one weekend. Compared to what they had to do, we’ve got it easy.

So why is it so hard for people to just stay home? (Obviously excluding essential workers)

### You got fake people showin’ fake love to you

#### So logically, you should betray your entire community.

**Game theory** looks at strategic interactions between rational people, and mathematically models what their interactions might look like. It’s used in fields like economics and computer science, just to name a few.

*(For this activity, I must ask that we all pretend to be rational people.)*

We can model the decision to quarantine/go out with a payoff matrix:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*Aw21vbneMLw2LcRdJxfXuQ.png)

‘You’ are you, and the ‘Others’ are the people in your community, workplace, class, etc. You both have the same set of decisions, or strategies, available to you: Stay In (quarantine) or Go Out (not quarantine). The combinations of the different strategies you both choose results in four different payoffs:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*UwCr5T3Y0hBXETVrZpMdBQ.png)

#### Top Left — the optimal collective outcome

These numbers represent months of utility (MOUs). If You and the Others choose to Stay In, (i.e. everyone quarantines) both parties lose only one MOU (-1) because we all flatten the curve and find a solution faster. Go team!

#### Bottom Right — the worst collective outcome

If both parties Go Out, (no one quarantines), then the virus spreads quicker and the government enforces a longer quarantine: everyone loses 2 MOUs. :(

#### Top Right — betray the others and come out on top

If You join the Dark Side and Go Out, you lose 0 MOUs. While everyone else is stuck at home, you gain an edge on your competitors in your class, workplace, community, etc. Sans competition, you become hyper-productive and squeeze 2 MOUs out of your time, putting you ahead of the Others.

The Others could have done this as well but chose not to, so this represents a 2-month opportunity cost on top of the 1 month they're losing because of quarantine, putting the Others’ payoff at -3.

#### Bottom Left — the others betray you and you get screwed

The same principle applies in reverse. If You Stay In while the Others Go Out, they lose 0 MOUs and you get a -3 payoff.

#### What do you do?
As a completely rational person, your objective is to maximize your personal payoff, which in this case means minimizing the MOUs lost to You. So let’s look at the best+worst case scenarios for each strategy.

#### If You choose to Stay In:

Your best-case scenario (combination with the highest payoff) is when Others Stay In: -1 MOU, or one month lost.

Your worst-case scenario (lowest payoff) occurs when Others Go Out: -3 MOUs.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/723/1*ru7jpt0-u0OkCEzszakZpQ.png)

#### If You choose to Go Out:

The best-case scenario is when Others Stay In: 0 MOUs lost

The worst-case scenario is when Others Go Out: -2 MOUs.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/723/1*Cet5PHBq6fcASxZeWBV8oQ.png)

```Stay In: Best Payoff = -1, Worst Payoff = -3```

```Go Out: Best Payoff = 0, Worst Payoff = -2```

```0 > -1, -2 > -3```

Both your best AND worst-case scenarios are better if You choose to Go Out, so as a rational person, that’s the strategy you choose. However, the Others will go through the exact same thought process as You.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*IAIrxcfUXyDZIjUfEWRS3Q.png)

With the same options available, their goal is also to minimize MOUs lost too— that means they will also choose to Go Out.

Both You and the Others Go Out, resulting in the worst possible payoff (-2,-2) — the infection spreads, and we all have to spend more time in quarantine.

This is a Prisoner’s Dilemma game, and logical thinking from both parties will always result in a globally inferior Nash equilibrium (both players Go Out, which sucks for everybody).

#### People are choosing not to quarantine because from their positions, it’s the most rational thing to do.

But no one is perfectly rational, and I doubt every non-quarantiner goes through this thought process when they decide to leave the house.

So what else is at play?

### Stick it to the man

#### Most Western cultures have a problem with authority

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*OOMfEFOSmmWkkLNVUsMv4A.jpeg)

When socio-cultural psychologists compare different cultures, they use a set of dimensions as a standard. Think of them like Myers-Briggs personality traits, but for different nations and cultural groups.

One of these dimensions is the power-distance index, or PDI. The PDI measures how willing the less-powerful people in a society are to accept rigid social hierarchies.

Countries with a high PDI score (Russia, China, Ecuador) tend to accept uneven power distribution and demonstrate deference to elders and authorities. Countries with low PDI scores look like this:

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:91%;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/hWA1mARt9sh4eKKo89" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/kiss-kiss-band-end-of-the-road-online-hWA1mARt9sh4eKKo89">via GIPHY</a></p>

Just kidding.

Low PDI countries (Germany, Sweden, the U.S.) tend to question authority more and have less hierarchical social structures.

Our culture’s PDI can affect our behaviour through the **voice effect**, which looks at how well you react to decisions from an authority depending on how much input (voice) you were allowed to have in them.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*OJkhRwwQczDl4DfSB6bz6A.jpeg)

Pretend you’re working at my hot new tech startup, **_papier_**, where we sell AI-powered toilet paper on the blockchain. We’re going through some big changes that will affect your work-life — including a new manager, either one of my trusted confidantes, Fernando and Esmerelda.

- If you get Fernando, someone who will consult you and others about your opinions before making a decision, how committed would you feel to papier?
- If you get Esmerelda, who couldn’t care less about your opinion and will make decisions without you, how committed would you be then?

**Brockner et al. (2001)** gave a similar scenario to (high PDI) Chinese and (low PDI) American students to see how their culture’s PDI score would affect the way they react to an authority’s decision.

Participants were all given similar situations — they were in a changing company, new manager, and so on. In the high voice condition, the manager was like Fernando — open to consulting you. In the low voice condition, the manager was like Esmerelda — less open to input.

Participants were then asked about their organizational commitment (which in this case represents how favourably they felt about the situation) via a questionnaire afterward, and results showed the following:

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/413/1*DjJYmIidU0vFnXfOleGbVA.png)

So while we all like to have a high level of input, low PDI citizens, like the ones in the U.S. and Canada, really don’t like it when they don’t have a voice in decision-making — accepting unilateral decisions from the government is just not in our culture.

Need more proof? There are protests happening in Russia — but they’re about financial aid for SMEs. AND THEY’RE HAPPENING ONLINE, MICHIGAN.

That being said, some Americans and Canadian may have a high personal belief in power distance, distinct from their culture — what about them?

### The brain wants what the brain wants

#### And your brain is lonely

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*n0xXooeRoPYwhQ4j8KnMbw.png)

Before we were worried about COVID-19, scientists were very worried about the global **loneliness epidemic**. About a fifth of all US and UK adults say they always or often feel lonely, which is a problem…

> “People who struggle with loneliness end up living shorter lives, and they also are at an increased risk for heart disease, depression, dementia, anxiety, and a host of other conditions.” — Vivek Murthy, former Surgeon General of the United States.

Our ancestors needed social groups to help them survive and take care of their young. We need them to form a protective wall around us if we see our exes in public.

Or is that just me?

#### Do what the dopamine says.

Quarantine limits the level of social interaction most of us want to have, so it makes sense that we’d try to get it back. The neurological basis for this behaviour lies within dopamine in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) region of the brain.

Dopamine is a chemical messenger that sends signals around the brain (a neurotransmitter) and is associated with good feelings — eating good food, hearing a funny joke, positive social interactions.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/0*EAmS-GWdfKBi9udz.jpg)

The DRN is a region of the brain that is especially serotonin-heavy (another neurotransmitter) and is associated with sleep cycles and depression.

Research by **Matthews et al. (2016)** showed that dopaminergic neurons in the DRN activated when mice were put through social isolation.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/315/1*nUOdBLcKXNVtngG1wUcPuA.png)
“Representative spatial heat maps showing the location of a ChR2-expressing mouse” | Red indicates more time spent in the area. | Source: Matthews et al. (2016)

They put these mice through the three-chambers task. The mouse starts off in the central region (shown by the dotted lines) and can go to either side. The social side (left side) has another mouse in it, the non-social side is empty.

When researchers turned ‘on’ the dopaminergic neurons, the mouse spent even more time in the social area than when the neurons were off.

#### What does this mean?

When in social isolation, the dopaminergic neurons in the DRN activate; like with the mice, they then motivate us to seek out more social interaction.

Hunger and pain are warning signs from your body:

> Go get food and/or medical assistance ASAP!

Similarly, loneliness is your brain telling you that you’re lacking the social interactions you need to survive, so go out and get them!

(Don’t actually go, though. Just hop on Houseparty or Zoom or whatever you kids are doing these days.)

### TL;DR — Why aren’t people quarantining?

- According to game theory, it’s the only rational decision because your best+worst case scenarios are better all-around if you go out instead of stay in.
- Disregarding authority (a low PDI) is part of our cultural profile, so we don’t respond well when the government makes a decision without us.
- Your brain’s dorsal raphe nucleus’ neurons start firing, motivating you to find social interactions.

#### Why does this matter to me?

- When choosing a partner in crime, find someone who is completely irrational and expendable — like a younger sibling. Otherwise, the prisoner’s dilemma will screw you both.
- If you’d like to start an anarchist uprising, this wouldn’t be a bad place to do it. Also, applications to join papier are open now.
- Loneliness is like hunger, it only stops if you do something about — go call your friends.
